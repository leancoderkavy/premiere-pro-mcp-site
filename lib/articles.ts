Instead of asking an assistant to guess what is on screen or operate the interface like a person, the server exposes named tools for supported tasks such as inspecting a sequence, organizing media, preparing an edit, applying a supported change, or sending an export to Adobe Media Encoder.",
          "MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, an open standard for connecting AI applications with external tools, data, and workflows. In this case, the external system is a Premiere project running on the editor’s computer. The useful outcome is not “AI edits a video by itself.” It is a more inspectable way to ask for repeatable Premiere work while the editor retains the creative decision and a chance to verify what happened.",

Premiere returns structured data, confirmation, or diagnostics to the client. The recommended setup keeps the server, connector, Premiere, and project media on the same computer.",
          "This architecture matters because a tool listing is not proof that a particular Premiere build can complete a particular operation. A robust workflow starts by checking the connection and available capabilities, then previewing or applying the smallest supported step, then inspecting the returned result. That is more dependable than treating natural-language output as evidence that a timeline changed.",

For example, an editor might ask for the active sequence and its clip structure before requesting a preview of a B-roll assembly.
